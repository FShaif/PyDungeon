# PyDungeon   
A Python Based Educational Text Adventure and Turn Based Game

# Instructions:
just run the main.py file and follow the instructions on the terminal

# Trivia:
this was my very first project while learning how to code using python in college
it included key concepts such as control structures, functions (arguments and return values), 
data structures, modules, error handling, OOP (classes, methods, inheritance), and standard libraries

# Special Thanks 
to my teacher Eng. Sami Alfattani and my dear friend Marwan Ahmed who encouraged and helped me complete this project
